# Covid-19 Vaccine Waitlist (01/21 - 04/21)

Covid-19 Vaccine Waitlist is a web app project sponsored by University of North Texas. It implements an algorithm to prioritize different sub priority groups which are grouped based on CDC guidelines and suggestions for easy vaccine assignment. All data is securely stored in a PostgreSQL database on Google Cloud Compute Engine VM.

## Usage 

Patients can (1) fill out a questionnaire to sign up for the waitlist, (2) be notified upon successful registration, and (3) view FAQ section.  
Admin can (1) view patients under 3 categories: waitlisting, notified for vaccine appointment and vaccinated, (2) select priority criteria to feed the algorithm and (3) enter the number of available vaccine doses for sending out mass notifications to qualified patients.

## Security

The web app can handle large number of visitors with fast speed. Admin password is encrypted, and all patients' information is protected agaisnt SQL injection attack.
